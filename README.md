## JavaScript and TypeScript Exam

## This is an Exam for JavaScript designed by html, tailwind, flowbite and TypeScript.

This test includes an input to receive numbers along with three buttons.

First button can give you a five-digit random number and display it on the top box.

Second button add five of the numbers stored in the input in an array and display that array in the console.

Third button can clear the input box value.

Last button check all the input contents are numbers or not and displaying the error with the alert() code.
Considering that the first button enters all the input content in the form of numbers, this error will almost never be seen.

I took help from JPT chat to answer this exam.
